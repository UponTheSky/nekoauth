# nekoauth
An OAuth2 service written in Go from scratch
The main reference for this project is [OAuth2 in Action by J. Richer and A. Sanso](https://www.amazon.com/OAuth-2-Action-Justin-Richer/dp/161729327X).

## Remark
Currently `client` is temporarily in this repository for educational purpose, but this will be moved to the [main backend project repository](https://github.com/UponTheSky/nekogallery) in the future.
